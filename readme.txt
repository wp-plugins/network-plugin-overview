== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why would I need this? =

I personally needed it to delete dated/forgotten plugins that posed a security risk by keeping around. Having a large number of different sites in a network, it's sometimes hard to determine which plugins are being used where. This plugin clearly highlights which plugins are not being used at all.

	> "...if you are not using a specific plugin, delete it from the system."

= Can I use it on a single installation instead of a network? =

No, just go to "Plugins" in the admin.
